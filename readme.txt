== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is GrooveFX free of charge? =

No, the price of all the listed services from GrooveFX is 0.98 euros per sale. There is no minimum, if you sell 3 products in the month, we will charge you 2.94 euros (0.98x3) the following month. Nevertheless, GrooveFX has the peculiarity of strongly increasing the conversion rate, so we don't doubt that you will sell more than that!

= RGB or CMYK output? =

Definitively RGB. We use web technologies, so most of the users send their photos in RGB with the suitable gamut for screens, digital camera, and so on.
Delivering RGB files in order to be performing by any printer RIP don't limit the color gamut upstream. 
Each machine and each technique have their own particularities, thus we believe that the right color profil should be set by the printer,depending on his own methods.
